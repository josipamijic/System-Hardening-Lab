# Scenario

A small organisation is deploying new systems — Windows 11 workstations, an Ubuntu
server, and a Windows Server that will become the company's Active Directory Domain
Controller. Before any of them go into use, each must be assessed and hardened against a
recognised security standard, rather than trusting the default "out of the box"
configuration.

This project plays the role of the person doing that work: assessing each system's
starting state, applying hardening measures, verifying the result, and documenting both
the changes and the honest limitations.

> All work was done in isolated Hyper-V lab virtual machines using fictional data
> (e.g. the domain `lab.local`).
